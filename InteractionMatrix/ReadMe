R program "interactionMatrixMaker" will create interaction matrix by ligands
files of proteins in Exploring-DTI-Networks/data/ligand_smiles/.

Steps to get interaction matrices;
1. Extract ligands file in a folder, such as "GPCRs";
2. Run R function "interactionMatrix" with the folder name like "GPCRs" as
input


Interaction matrices are sparse matrices, so they contain a lot of NAs and 
their dimensions are very high. It will take a few moments to open those CSV files.
