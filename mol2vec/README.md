# Mol2vec
This folder contains a trained mol2vec molel, which is based on the word2vec NLP algorithm, and used to generate features in our molecules data set. The model is trained using a corpus of 20 million molecules, and embeds molecules in 300-dimensional space.

## Required Python modules:

- [mol2vec](https://github.com/samoturk/mol2vec)
- RDKit
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
