# Data used in this project

## receptor_ids
Contains Uniprot ids and gene names for receptors from the four major classes of druggable proteins: GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. The data was downloaded from [Pharos](https://pharos.nih.gov), and the receptors were filtered to include only those within the **Tclin** and **Tchem** categories, meaning that they have a sufficient number of known interacting compounds.
